# Carbon Emissions Prediction

A machine learning project focused on predicting carbon emissions using data analysis and predictive modeling techniques.

## 📋 Project Overview

This project aims to develop a predictive model for carbon emissions using various environmental and industrial factors. The goal is to create accurate predictions that can help in environmental planning and policy-making decisions.

## 🚀 Features

- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering and selection
- Machine learning model development
- Model evaluation and validation
- Prediction visualization
